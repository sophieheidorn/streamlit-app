## Clone Repo (use this template)

- In this GitHub repo, click on "Use this Template" (the green button at the top of this page)

- In your GitHub-Account, download the `streamlit-app` repository to your machine with GitHub Desktop

- In your terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Command Prompt (Windows), cd into the `streamlit-app` folder

```bash
cd streamlit-app
```

- Now we install all needed Python libraries from the `environment.yml` file to create a virtual environment named `streamlit`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Activate the `streamlit` environment:

```bash
conda activate streamlit
```

- cd into 1-first-app

```bash
cd 1-first-app
```

- Start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- While developing a Streamlit app, it's recommended to lay out your editor and browser windows side by side, so the code and the app can be seen at the same time. 

- Complete the code with the help of this [Cheat Sheet](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/cheatsheet).

- If you are done, go to your terminal and stop your app with `Ctrl+C`
